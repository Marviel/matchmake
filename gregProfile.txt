2 truths and a lie
I don't drink alcohol nor coffee (don't mind if you do); I worked on the Obama campaign; l'm a professional dancer

Teach me something about
fashion, both women's (e.g. why high slit dresses look good on certain people) and men's â€” l've learned I prefer gold over silver, and bright over muted tones

Swipe right if you
are vaccinated, go to therapy, love wearing costumes + wilder clothes. Want a relationship where we help each other be our best selves
